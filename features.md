## Javascript Features

**param** - An object containing key-values from the current URL hash, parameters in the URL, and parameters set on the javascript include file.  

**hashChangeEvent** - triggered when the URL hash is changed both programmatically and by the user.  This allows multiple widgets to respond to changes without being directly bound, including when backing up.  

**lazy** - A class for loading images just before they scroll into view.  

**loadMarkdown** - Loads readme files and converts links and image tags based on folder levels.
